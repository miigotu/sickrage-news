 - if you have issues with strange characters (ie. ƒÆ'A+â?TAƒâ) in files names and/or in the SR interface and/or your database file (sickbeard.db) is suddenly way bigger than it should be please FULL update & refresh all your shows and force a mass rename after. Depending on your library size it can take some minutes or some hours. Backup DB first.

<br/>

####2015-07-23####

 - Now you can choose your default page when opening/logging to SR (General Options > Misc > Initial page)

  (Committed on July 15)

  This might help if you have SSL errors

- Added new sub-menu called "Changelog". You can check what has changed in SickRage in each release

+ **Default Episode Status**: We recently fixed this feature so you need  to:

    - Edit your shows via 'Mass update' and set the default status to WANTED instead of SKIPPED (if you want unaired episodes to be downloaded)
    - Set all new episodes that were marked SKIPPED before that to WANTED. You can check all of them at "Episode Status Management" selecting "SKIPPED" in "Manage episodes with status". Be carefull with this! Make sure you have a backup of your database. Be advised!
    - Now when you will add a **NEW** show you will be asked for two status settings: already aired episodes and unaired episodes.
